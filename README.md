# Heap Data Structures Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of heap data structures, including Heapsort and Priority Queue operations. The project demonstrates the use of heaps in sorting algorithms and as a priority queue data structure.

### Contents
1. **Heapsort**: An implementation of the Heapsort algorithm using a max-heap.
2. **Sorting Comparison**: A comparison of Heapsort with Quicksort and Mergesort based on execution time for random input arrays.
3. **Priority Queue**: A priority queue implemented using a max-heap, with operations like insert, extract_max, increase_key, and decrease_key.

## Files
- `heapsort.py`: Implementation of the Heapsort algorithm.
- `sorting_comparison.py`: Code to compare Heapsort with Quicksort and Mergesort.
- `priority_queue.py`: Implementation of a priority queue using a max-heap.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed.
- No external libraries are required for running the code.

## Usage

### 1. **Heapsort**
Run the `heapsort.py` file to sort an array using the Heapsort algorithm.
